# 🔒 Audio Access Reverted to Premium-Only

## **Changes Made:**

### ✅ **Premium Service** (`premium_service.dart`)
**Before**: Temporary testing bypass allowed all users to access audio
```dart
// OLD CODE - Testing bypass enabled
debugPrint('[PremiumService] ⚠️ Non-premium user - temporary audio access for testing');
return true; // Temporary: allow audio for testing
```

**After**: Strict premium-only access enforced
```dart
// NEW CODE - Premium-only access
debugPrint('[PremiumService] 🚫 Non-premium user - audio access denied');
return false;
```

### ✅ **Audio Player Service** (`audio_player_service.dart`)
**Before**: Complex fallback logic for testing
```dart
// OLD CODE - Testing fallbacks
try {
  final user = await _premiumService.getPremiumStatus();
  if (!user.hasAudioAccess) {
    throw Exception('Premium subscription required');
  }
} catch (e) {
  debugPrint('Premium check failed, allowing for testing: $e');
  // Allow audio playback when premium check fails
}
```

**After**: Clean premium-only validation
```dart
// NEW CODE - Direct premium check
if (!isPremium && !canAccessAudio) {
  debugPrint('🚫 [AudioPlayerService] Non-premium user blocked from audio');
  throw Exception('Premium subscription required for audio playback');
}
```
