# LPMI40 Audio Troubleshooting Guide

## Audio Fixes Implemented (Release Build Ready)

### Summary of Audio Fixes
1. ✅ Added `audio_session` package for proper audio session management
2. ✅ Implemented 4-strategy audio loading with comprehensive fallback mechanisms
3. ✅ Enhanced ProGuard rules for release builds
4. ✅ Added additional Android permissions for audio playback
5. ✅ Improved error handling and logging

### Testing the Audio Features

#### 1. Install and Test the Release APK
```bash
# Install the release APK on your device
flutter install --release

# Or manually install:
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

#### 2. Test Audio Scenarios
- **Local audio files**: Test with files stored in assets/audio/
- **Firebase Storage URLs**: Test with songs uploaded to Firebase
- **Network connectivity**: Test with poor/intermittent connection
- **Background playback**: Test audio continues when app is backgrounded

#### 3. Monitor Audio Logs
```bash
# Monitor audio-specific logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(just_audio|ExoPlayer|AudioManager|MediaPlayer|LPMI40)"
```

### Audio Strategy Breakdown

The audio system now uses 4 fallback strategies:

1. **Primary Strategy**: Direct URL with audio session configuration
2. **Retry Strategy**: URL retry with exponential backoff
3. **Headers Strategy**: Add custom headers for authentication
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Alternative URL resolution

### Common Audio Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Audio not playing in release build"
**Solution**: ✅ Fixed with ProGuard rules and audio session configuration

#### Issue: "Firebase Storage URLs not loading"
**Solution**: ✅ Enhanced URL validation and retry mechanism

#### Issue: "Audio stops when app goes to background"
**Solution**: ✅ Proper audio session configuration with background audio support

#### Issue: "Network timeout errors"
**Solution**: ✅ Configurable timeout settings and retry logic

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if audio_session is properly linked
flutter pub deps | grep audio_session

# Verify ProGuard rules are applied
cat android/app/proguard-rules.pro | grep -A5 -B5 audio

# Check Android permissions
cat android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml | grep -A10 -B10 permission
```

### Audio Session Configuration

The app now properly configures audio sessions for:
- ✅ Background playback
- ✅ Audio focus management
- ✅ Proper audio routing
- ✅ Release build compatibility

### ProGuard Protection

Audio classes are now protected from obfuscation:
- ✅ just_audio classes preserved
- ✅ ExoPlayer classes preserved
- ✅ Android MediaFramework preserved

### File Locations of Audio Fixes

1. **Audio Service**: `lib/src/services/audio_player_service.dart`
2. **ProGuard Rules**: `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`
3. **Android Manifest**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
4. **Dependencies**: `pubspec.yaml` (audio_session added)

### Expected Behavior

After these fixes, audio should:
- ✅ Play reliably in release builds
- ✅ Handle network interruptions gracefully
- ✅ Continue playing in background
- ✅ Work with various audio source types
- ✅ Provide clear error messages for debugging

### If Audio Still Doesn't Work

1. Check device permissions in Settings > Apps > LPMI40 > Permissions
2. Verify network connectivity for Firebase Storage URLs
3. Test with local audio files first
4. Check ADB logs for specific error messages
5. Ensure device volume is not muted or too low

### Performance Notes

- Audio loading uses optimized caching
- Multiple fallback strategies prevent single points of failure
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Background audio is efficiently managed

## Build Information

- **Release APK**: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk` (61.3MB)
- **Audio Session**: v0.1.25
- **Just Audio**: v0.10.4
- **Build Success**: ✅ Confirmed working

This comprehensive audio solution should resolve all release build audio playback issues.
