## 📁 Files Created

✅ **Main Dashboard**: `/lib/src/features/dashboard/presentation/revamped_dashboard_page.dart`
✅ **Header Component**: `/lib/src/features/dashboard/presentation/widgets/revamped_dashboard_header.dart`
✅ **Sections Component**: `/lib/src/features/dashboard/presentation/widgets/revamped_dashboard_sections.dart`

✅ **Enhanced Preferences**: `/lib/src/core/services/preferences_service.dart` (updated)

## 🔧 Integration Options

### Option 1: Replace Current Dashboard (Recommended)

Replace your current dashboard import in `main.dart`:

**From:**
```dart
import 'package:lpmi40/src/features/dashboard/presentation/dashboard_page.dart';
```

**To:**
```dart
import 'package:lpmi40/src/features/dashboard/presentation/revamped_dashboard_page.dart';
```

**Then update the home widget:**
```dart
// Change from:
home: const DashboardPage(),

// To:
home: const RevampedDashboardPage(),
```

### Option 2: Side-by-Side Testing

Keep both dashboards and add a toggle option:

1. **Create a dashboard selector**:
```dart
// In your main app or settings
bool useRevampedDashboard = true; // Toggle this for testing

// In your routing logic:
home: useRevampedDashboard 
    ? const RevampedDashboardPage()
    : const DashboardPage(),
```

2. **Add a settings option** to switch between dashboards for testing.

### Option 3: Gradual Migration

Test the revamped dashboard with specific user roles first:

```dart
Widget buildDashboard(User? user, bool isAdmin, bool isSuperAdmin) {
  // Use revamped dashboard for admins first
  if (isAdmin || isSuperAdmin) {
    return const RevampedDashboardPage();
  }
  
  // Keep current dashboard for regular users during testing
  return const DashboardPage();
}
```
